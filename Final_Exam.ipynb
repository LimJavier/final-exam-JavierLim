        "Before asking AI to generate pseudocode, I identified the technical requirements of the program based on the provided question. This aligns with the \"Six-Step Methodology\" from Week 2, where I should understand the problem and identify specific input and output before asking for pseudocode. Furthermore, I manually analysed the initial pseudocode and identified areas for improvement, specifically in terms of error handling. I referred to my course materials in Week 11 to address the common errors in Python, such as input validation using basic exception handling. The first refinement significantly improved the robustness of the task manager system, as it enhanced the error handling that was previously overlooked in the initial version. The second refinement further enhances the program's functionality with additional features, including options to delete all tasks at once and a confirmation prompt to save the task before exiting. This improvement is directly connected to the conditionals and logical concepts introduced in Week 3.  "
